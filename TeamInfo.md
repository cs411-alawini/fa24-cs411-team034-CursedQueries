# Summary
Many students struggle to find peers to study with when preparing for difficult classes. Because this class did not have a structured team matchmaker, a campuswire post had to be hastily made to account for the issue. Our project tackles this issue for all classes on campus, as the Study Group Finder is a centralized matchmaking website that allows students in common classes to find or form study groups. Users could create/join groups, and customize a profile to specify preferences to conveniently help with group formation.

The website will grant students the ability to create and find new groups primarily based on class. To find existing groups, there will be a search based on the course code, filtered by categories like availability and topic. Upon selecting a potential group to join, there will be a calendar feature on the website to help students actually set up the group’s meeting based on their availability. Communication between students will happen outside the app where the group searcher finds the group creator’s contact through their profile info.
